package com.facebook.stetho.dumpapp;

/**
 * Provides a CLI (command-line interface) facility for {@code fbandroid} modules.
 *
 * <p>Binding an instance of this interface allows you to inject custom debug/dumping code into the
 * app that is accessible when a phone running the app is connected via ADB. To see a list of
 * current plugins, see:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   ./scripts/dumpapp --list
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>General Utility</h3>
 *
 * <p>This system allows for complex components to inform developers of what's been going on
 * recently (or over the process lifetime) in a simple, human-readable fashion. Good candidates for
 * this kind of interface are those that are otherwise hard to isolate or visualize such as the
 * network stack or task runners (BlueService, Executor, etc). It is also possible to create a kind
 * of simple instrumentation around components that otherwise have no UI. For example, it may be
 * useful to be able to clear the image cache or delete individual entries on demand as well as
 * viewing the current state of all cached entries.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Guidelines</h3>
 * <p>
 * Almost any kind of simple interface will work however there are some basic guidelines that you
 * should follow:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Avoid heavy-weight plugins that add significant additional code to the app. While this code
 *       does not ship in katana (proguard strips it out), it is generally a good idea to evaluate
 *       large or complex instrumentation projects in the greater context of tools available at
 *       Facebook (in particular Scuba which can aggregate data for our user base in the wild). 1 or
 *       2 classes is a good rule of thumb for reasonable plugin size.
 *   <li>Don't implement long-running jobs in {@link #dump}. If the instrumented action takes a long
 *       time, consider a way to "fire-and-forget" so that you can return some message to the caller
 *       quickly.
 *   <li>Don't perform extra up-front initialization not normally needed by the app. Dumpers should
 *       init on demand so that there is no runtime impact to the app.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Gotchas</h3>
 *
 * <p>In order for dumpapp to work the app must currently be running and there is an initialization
 * overhead of the "dumper" system which may make real-time debug output during app startup tricky
 * or impossible. However, you can work around this by implementing simple stat counters that can be
 * pulled and reset within your plugin. After initialization completes (and thus dumpapp becomes
 * available), you can query for the stats that were being collected while the app was starting.
