/**
 * When streaming output, it is common for the user to just hit Ctrl-C to terminate the stream. When
 * this happens, the underlying output stream throws an {@link IOException} to indicate the pipe is
 * broken. Dumpapp uses a {@link PrintStream} to wrap the underlying {@link OutputStream} though,
 * and {@link PrintStream} silently swallows {@link IOException}.
 *
 * <p>While streaming dumpers can/should check {@link PrintStream#checkError}, this is used in cases
 * where we know the stream has gone bad to force flow control out of the dumper and back into the
 * calling machinery that controls the stream framer.
